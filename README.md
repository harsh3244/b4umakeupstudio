B4U Makeup Studio — Coming Soon

This is a simple, responsive "Coming Soon" landing page built with HTML, Tailwind CSS (via CDN), and GSAP for entrance animations. It uses placeholder SVGs for the owner photo and achievements which you can replace with real JPEG/PNG images.

Files
- index.html — main page
- styles.css — small custom styles
- assets/ — placeholder SVG images (mausi_image.svg, achievement1.svg, achievement2.svg, achievement3.svg)

Quick start
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Replace `assets/*.svg` with your own images. Keep the same filenames or update `index.html` image paths.

Notes
- Tailwind is loaded via CDN for rapid iteration. For production, consider installing Tailwind and building a CSS file.
- GSAP is used for subtle fade-in animations. Remove the script tag if you prefer pure CSS animations.

Contact
Replace placeholder links and text with real contact or social links.
